Polarization Resistance (Rp): Polarization resistance is related to the ease with which current flows through your system in response to a small applied potential around the corrosion potential. It is a measure of the electrochemical reactionâ€™s resistance to corrosion and can be measured by a technique called Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR). To test this theory to match the literature before putting to practice our hypothetical setup, however, with our simple setup, we might not be able to apply the exact LPR method, but we can still measure resistance chances.
